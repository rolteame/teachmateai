## Design Methodology

I wanted to have a task manager that can track the status of all tasks at a glance.

A Task overview component is used to that effect, this tracks the number of tasks in each category.

Also i opted to using cards for listing task the edit icon embedded into the card

I also color coded the status to match with the overview colors.
